# You will receive three integer numbers.
# Write functions named:
# â€¢ sum_numbers() that returns the sum of the first two integers
# â€¢ subtract() that returns the difference between the returned result of the first function and the third integer
# Wrap the two functions in a function named add_and_subtract() which will receive the three numbers as parameters.
# Print the result of the subtract() function on the console.
#
# Input1:
# 23
# 6
# 10
#
# Output1: 19
#
# Input2:
# 1
# 17
# 30
#
# Output2: -12
#
# Input3:
# 42
# 58
# 100
#
# Output3: 0
