# You are tasked to create three classes: a Song class, an Album class, and a Band class.
# The Song class should receive a name (string), a length (float), and a single (bool) upon initialization.
# It has one method:
# -	get_info()
#   o	Returns the information of the song in this format: "{song_name} - {song_length}"
#
# The Album class should receive a name (string) upon initialization and might receive one or more songs.
# It also has instance attributes: published (False by default) and songs (an empty list). It has four methods:
# -	add_song(song: Song)
#   o	Adds the song to the album and returns "Song {song_name} has been added to the album {name}."
#   o	If the song is single, returns "Cannot add {song_name}. It's a single"
#   o	If the album is published, returns "Cannot add songs. Album is published."
#   o	If the song is already added, return "Song is already in the album."
# -	remove_song(song_name: str)
#   o	Removes the song with the given name and returns "Removed song {song_name} from album {album_name}."
#   o	If the song is not in the album, return "Song is not in the album."
#   o	If the album is published, returns "Cannot remove songs. Album is published."
#
# -	publish()
#   o	Publishes the album (set to True) and returns "Album {name} has been published."
#   o	If the album is published, returns "Album {name} is already published."
# -	details()
#   o	Returns the information of the album, with the songs in it, in the format:
# "Album {name}
#  == {first_song_info}
#  == {second_song_info}
#  â€¦
#  == {n_song_info}"
#
# The Band class should receive a name (string) upon initialization. It also has an attribute albums (an empty list).
# The class has three methods:
# -	add_album(album: Album)
#   o	Adds an album to the collection and returns "Band {band_name} has added their newest album {album_name}."
#   o	If the album is already added, returns "Band {band_name} already has {album_name} in their library."
# -	remove_album(album_name: str)
#   o	Removes the album from the collection and returns "Album {name} has been removed."
#   o	If the album is published, return "Album has been published. It cannot be removed."
#   o	If the album is not in the collection, return "Album {name} is not found."
# -	details()
#   o	Returns the information of the band, with their albums, in this format:
# "Band {name}
#  {album details}
#  ...
#  {album details}"
#
# Test code:
# song = Song("Running in the 90s", 3.45, False)
# print(song.get_info())
# album = Album("Initial D", song)
# second_song = Song("Around the World", 2.34, False)
# print(album.add_song(second_song))
# print(album.details())
# print(album.publish())
# band = Band("Manuel")
# print(band.add_album(album))
# print(band.remove_album("Initial D"))
# print(band.details())
#
# Output:
# Running in the 90s - 3.45
# Song Around the World has been added to the album Initial D.
# Album Initial D
# == Running in the 90s - 3.45
# == Around the World - 2.34
#
# Album Initial D has been published.
# Band Manuel has added their newest album Initial D.
# Album has been published. It cannot be removed.
# Band Manuel
# Album Initial D
# == Running in the 90s - 3.45
# == Around the World - 2.34
