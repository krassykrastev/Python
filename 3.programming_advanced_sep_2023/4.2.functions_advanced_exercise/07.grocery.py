# Create a function called grocery_store() that receives a different number of key-value pairs. The key will be the
# product's name and the value - its quantity. You should return a sorted receipt for all products. They should be
# sorted by their quantity in descending order. If there are two or more products with the same quantity, sort them by
# their name's length in descending order. If there are two or more products with the same name's length, sort them by
# their name in ascending order (alphabetically). In the end, return a string in the following format:
# "{product_name1}: {product_quantity1}
# {product_name2}: {product_quantity2}
# â€¦
# {product_nameN}: {product_quantityN}"
#
# Input1:
# print(grocery_store(
#     bread=5,
#     pasta=12,
#     eggs=12,
# ))
#
# Output1:
# pasta: 12
# eggs: 12
# bread: 5
#
# Input2:
# print(grocery_store(
#     bread=2,
#     pasta=2,
#     eggs=20,
#     carrot=1,
# ))
#
# Output2:
# eggs: 20
# bread: 2
# pasta: 2
# carrot: 1
